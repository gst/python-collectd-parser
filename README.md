======================

Python Collectd Binary Protocol Parser was originally written by Adrian Perez for Collectd v4.9. In this repository, you can find an updated copy for Collectd v5.1. You can find the updated code here as well as a diff of the changes.

You can use the parser at the other end of the Collectd Network Plugin, e.g. Collectd -> Network -> Parser -> Your Library.
